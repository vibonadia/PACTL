# PACTL


PACTL is a planner based on the α-CTL logic. This repository contains a prototype of PACTL. Some publications about the α-CTL logic can be found at:

* [A logic-based agent that plans for extended reachability goals](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10458-008-9034-0)

PACTL-Sym is the symbolic version of the α-CTL planner for FOND planning problems. Currently, the code for PACTL-Sym is not available (we are working on improvements and code clarity before making it public). Some papers about PACTL-Sym can be found at:

* [Symbolic FOND Planning for Temporally Extended Goals](https://icaps22.icaps-conference.org/workshops/KEPS/KEPS-22_paper_4759.pdf)
* [Symbolic Planning for Strong-Cyclic Policies](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8923667)
